# My-Web-Browser-Game

-Inspiration For Game-

The Inspiration for this game came from a couple of different places. I wanted to create a game that was 
fun to play, a competitive game, user engaging with a little humor. I tried to implement some of the
following traits from these well known games:
  
  Kahoot - I tried to implement the logic of the scoring (where the fastest person to correctly answer the 
  question gets the points.) The difference in my game, was the points were all worth the same amount when
   the question was answered correctly.
 
 Trivia Games - I used multiple choice questions as the main focus of the game.

 Simple slider race game - I used the method to create the movement of the player racers to slide across 
 the screen the simulate a race.



 -Controls for the Game-

 There were no controls for the game, because you couldn't really move the players or the racers. The only
 way the racers moved were due to the user answering the question correctly. The players were given a input
 box to type their answers in and a submit button to click once the answer was entered in the box.



 -How to play the Game-

 The users entered their name in the Your Name Section next to the player icon of their choosing (cat or mouse) 
 at the top of the page.

 After the name is entered the game will start!

 A question will be displayed in the center of the game in the question display box.

 The players will have 5 seconds to answer the question correctly by typing their answer in the Answer Box, 
 then pressing the Submit button.
 -correct Answers are worth 10 points
 -incorrect Answers are worth -5 points

 The player that inputs the correct Answer the fastest will recieve the points(10) for the question and that 
 players racer will move across the race track simulating the chase between players.

 This will continue until all the questions have been asked.

 After all the questions have been asked the points will be totaled and the winner with the most points
 will be the winner!
   - The winning player will have a pop up image and message.


 -Technologies Used to make game- 

 Program Language:
     * JavaScript - For DOM interaction.
     * HTML5 - for rendering code to work directly with the browser.
     * CSS - for styling layout, giving the game it's visual presentation.
     * Event Handlers - to capture user or player input events such as clicks.



 * Github - for deployment, tracking changes and updates.

 * Artificle Intelligence (AI) - Used ChatGTP to help with this code.

-Unfinished Functionality-

* Need to fix the time duration on question display. Sometimes the questions will work on the timer and automatically switch when its supposed to 
and other times it won't.

* Need to fix the movement of the racers to make the game more fluid and appealng to the users. 

* I was having troublemaking the racers follow the same path to simulate more of a chase scenario.

* Need to fix and style the css better, need to remove the large icons at the bottom of the page.
